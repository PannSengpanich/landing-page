              What is jazz? Jazz is a music genre that originated in the
              African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the
              late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and
              ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a
              major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music.
              Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords,
              call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has
              roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.

              28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He
              is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history
              of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical
              directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront
              of many major stylistic developments in jazz.

              <strong>Herbert Jeffrey Hancock </strong>(born April 12, 1940) is
              an American jazz pianist, keyboardist, bandleader, and composer.
              Hancock started his career with trumpeter Donald Byrd's group. He
              shortly thereafter joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped
              to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the
              primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, Hancock
              experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles, utilizing
              a wide array of synthesizers and electronics. It was during this
              period that he released perhaps his best-known and most
              influential album, Head Hunters.

              <strong>Charles Parker Jr. </strong>(August 29, 1920 – March 12,
              1955), nicknamed "Bird" or "Yardbird", was an American jazz
              saxophonist, band leader and composer.[1] Parker was a highly
              influential soloist and leading figure in the development of
              bebop,a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic
              technique, and advanced harmonies. Parker was an extremely
              brilliant virtuoso and introduced revolutionary rhythmic and
              harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new
              variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Primarily a
              player of the alto saxophone, Parker's tone ranged from clean and
              penetrating to sweet and somber.
