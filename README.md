# landing-page
The Landing Page project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Foundation Course. It is an introductory-level project that involves building a simple landing page for a fictional product or service.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML and CSS, to create a visually appealing and informative landing page that showcases the product or service and encourages visitors to take action. The Landing Page project requires the use of HTML to create the structure of the page, CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing, and basic design principles to create a cohesive and engaging page.

The project provides an opportunity to practice designing and styling web pages, working with HTML and CSS code, and applying basic design principles to create a professional-looking landing page. It is a great exercise for beginners to get hands-on experience and build a basic web page that can be expanded upon in future projects.
