# landing-page
The Landing Page project is a web development project included in The Odin Project curriculum. It is a beginner-level project that involves building a simple but effective landing page for a product or service.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a visually appealing and informative landing page that attracts visitors and encourages them to take action. The Landing Page project requires the use of HTML and CSS to create the layout and style of the page, as well as JavaScript to add interactive elements such as navigation menus, buttons, and forms.

The project provides an opportunity to practice designing and styling web pages.
